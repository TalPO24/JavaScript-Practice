//* JavaScript Programs
// A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

// In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

// A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

//* In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

//* JavaScript Statements
// JavaScript statements are composed of:

// Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

// This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";

// The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

//* JavaScript Keywords
// JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

// Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

// Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:
